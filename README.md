# multivac server

This is the server portion of Multivac. Multivac is a simple app for 
storing tagged snippets of information.

This is probably the 10th version of this note-taking app. I rewrite it
probably once a year. This time the server is written in Clojure, and
the command-line client is written in Common Lisp since the JVM startup
time made the Clojure version a little too slow.

The name comes from a short story by Isaac Asimov about a computer that
eventually collects enough information to recreate the universe:
